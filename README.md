When you run the game the first thing you see is this menu:
<img src="README images/main menu.png">

You can control it with the Up and Down arrows on your PC keyboard. When you choose *Play* there is another menu, where you need to choose the difficulty of the game you want to play: *Easy*, *Medium* or *Hard*.

In the game you control the little smily face with all of the arrow keys on your keyboard. And when you are done it should be something like this:
