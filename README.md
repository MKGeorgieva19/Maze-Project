You can control it with the Up and Down arrow keys on your PC keyboard. When you choose *Play* there is another menu, where you need to choose the difficulty of the game you want to play: *Easy*, *Medium* or *Hard*.

In the game you control the little smiley face with all of the arrow keys on your keyboard. When you are done it should look something like this:
